### project idea - first day ###

we started our plan - sport-picks
have an app that gives odds to sports/leagues. have guru(s) that can sell picks to public
people will see odds from multiple bookmakers. this is not a gambling app.. it is more of a reference for making sports bets. so the goal would be to charge people for the picks.

This idea came up from personal experience 

 
### project idea - revised ### 

we are switching to a subcription model. where we will not be providing gurus instead we are providing a platform for gurus to signup up and sell picks to their following. new name OnlyPicks !! 
we have desinged our wireframe.
