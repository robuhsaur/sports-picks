Robbie had finished the Signup/Signin/logout for the user side, as I finished the Guru side. I kept getting an error code 1 for fastAPI in docker. Tried fixing it all day.

## October 18, 2022

Problem with the error code 1 was because of my macbook chip. Not sure why it just started giving me the error now, but its fixed. Finally got Guru Signup/Signin/logout working.
